Chordjerl
=========

The goal of Chordjerl (pronounced: cordial) is to be an reusable Erlang
implementation of the Chord protocol. 

Chord
=====

Chord is a distributed lookup protocol for efficient location of a node that
stores a desired data item in a decentralized, peer-to-peer system.

Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key
onto a node.

The Chord algorithm provides the foundation for a reliable, efficient, scalable
decentralized distributed hash.

You can read more about Chord in the paper from Stoica et al. "Chord: A
Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications" (http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf)
