+ finish up some tests oon finger tables and successor lists
* create successor lists as record attribute and not just the hd of fingers
* write timers to periodically call stabilize and fix fingers
* update stabilization to use successor list
  * grab the first present successor's successor list in case of failure
* figure out a nice way to detect node failure with ari
* use that node failure method to detect failed predecessors, successors
  * actually, what you're going to find is that *every* call to another node needs
    to call with a timeout. if it times out you need to a) update state
    accordingly b) retry with the next node of that type
* closest preceeding node needs to be updated with the new successor list
